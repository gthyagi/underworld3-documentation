  abstract = {Elasticity is described in general by a fourth-order tensor with 21 independent coefficients, which corresponds to the triclinic symmetry class. However seismological observations are usually explained with a higher order of symmetry using fewer parameters. We propose an analytical method to decompose the elastic tensor into a sum of orthogonal tensors belonging to the different symmetry classes. The method relies on a vectorial description of the elastic tensor. Any symmetry class constitutes a subspace of a class of lower symmetry and an orthogonal projection on this subspace removes the lower symmetry part. Orthogonal projectors on each higher symmetry class are given explicitly. In addition, the method provides optimal higher symmetry approximations, which allow us to decrease the number of independent parameters. Consequences of the symmetry approximation of the elastic tensor on shear wave splitting (SWS) are investigated for upper-mantle minerals (olivine and enstatite), natural samples and numerically deformed olivine aggregates. The orthorhombic part of the elastic tensor as well as the presence of enstatite are important second-order effects.},

  abstract = {Incompressibility is established for three- and two-dimensional deformations of an anisotropic linearly elastic material, as conditions to be satis ed by the elastic compliances. These conditions make it straightforward to derive results for incompressible materials from those established for compressible materials. As an illustration, the explicit secular equation is obtained for surface waves in incompressible monoclinic materials with the symmetry plane at x3 = 0. This equation also covers the case of incompressible orthotropic materials. The displacements and stresses for surface waves are often expressed in terms of the elastic sti nesses, which can be unbounded in the incompressible limit. An alternative formalism in terms of the elastic compliances presented recently by Ting (Proc. R. Soc. London (2002), in press) is employed so that surface wave solutions in the incompressible limit can be obtained. A di erent formalism, also by Ting (Proc. R. Soc. London A 455 (1999) 69), is employed to study the solutions to two-dimensional elastostatic problems. In the special case of incompressible monoclinic materials with the symmetry plane at x3 = 0, one of the three Barnett{\textendash}Lothe tensors S vanishes while the other two tensors H and L are the inverse of each other. Moreover, H and L are diagonal with the  rst two diagonal elements being identical. Many interesting physical phenomena can be deduced using this property. For instance, there is no interpenetration of the interface crack surfaces in an incompressible bimaterial. When only the inplane deformation is considered, the image force due to a line dislocation in a half-space or in a bimaterial depends on the magnitude, not on the direction, of the Burgers vector. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Combining finite element methods for the incompressible Stokes equations with particle-in-cell methods is an important technique in computational geodynamics that has been widely applied in mantle convection, lithosphere dynamics and crustal-scale modelling. In these applications, particles are used to transport along properties of the medium such as the temperature, chemical compositions or other material properties; the particle methods are therefore used to reduce the advection equation to an ordinary differential equation for each particle, resulting in a problem that is simpler to solve than the original equation for which stabilization techniques are necessary to avoid oscillations.             On the other hand, replacing field-based descriptions by quantities only defined at the locations of particles introduces numerical errors. These errors have previously been investigated, but a complete understanding from both the theoretical and practical sides was so far lacking. In addition, we are not aware of systematic guidance regarding the question of how many particles one needs to choose per mesh cell to achieve a certain accuracy.             In this paper we modify two existing instantaneous benchmarks and present two new analytic benchmarks for time-dependent incompressible Stokes flow in order to compare the convergence rate and accuracy of various combinations of finite elements, particle advection and particle interpolation methods. Using these benchmarks, we find that in order to retain the optimal accuracy of the finite element formulation, one needs to use a sufficiently accurate particle interpolation algorithm. Additionally, we observe and explain that for our higher-order finite-element methods it is necessary to increase the number of particles per cell as the mesh resolution increases (i.e. as the grid cell size decreases) to avoid a reduction in convergence order.             Our methods and results allow designing new particle-in-cell methods with specific convergence rates, and also provide guidance for the choice of common building blocks and parameters such as the number of particles per cell. In addition, our new time-dependent benchmark provides a simple test that can be used to compare different implementations, algorithms and for the assessment of new numerical methods for particle interpolation and advection. We provide a reference implementation of this benchmark in aspect (the `Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion'), an open source code for geodynamic modelling.},

In this paper we will give a detailed description of this code. The temperature equation is advanced in time with the Lagrangian marker techniques based on the method of characteristics and the temperature solution is interpolated back to an Eulerian grid configuration at each timestep. This marker approach allows for the accurate portrayal of very fine thermal structures. For attaining a high relative accuracy in the solution of the matrix equations associated with both the momentum and temperature equations, we have employed the direct matrix inversion technique, which becomes feasible with the advent of very large shared-memory machines. Our conservative finite-difference schemes allow us to capture sharp variations of the stresses and thermal gradients in problems with a strongly variable viscosity and thermal conductivity. We have tested this code with numerous examples drawn from Rayleigh{\textendash}Taylor instabilities, the descent of a stiff object into a medium with a lower viscosity, viscous heating and flows with non-Netwonian rheology. We have also benchmarked successfully with variable viscosity convection for lateral viscosity contrast up to 108. We have delineated the regions in thermal problems where the diffusive nature of the temperature equation changes from its parabolic character locally to a non-linear hyperbolic-like equation due to the presence of variable thermal conductivity. Finally we discuss the applicability of this marker-based and finite-difference technique to other evolutionary equations in geophysics.},

  abstract = {Cooling and thickening of lithospheric plates with age and subduction result in large-scale horizontal density contrasts tending to drive plate motions and mantle flow. We quantify the driving forces associated with these density contrasts to determine if they can drive the observed plate motions. First, two-dimensional models are computed to evaluate the effects of assumed rheologies and boundary conditions. We are unable to obtain platelike behavior in viscous models with traction-free boundary conditions. The piecewise uniform velocities distinctive of plate motion can be imposed as boundary conditions and the dynamic consistency of the models evaluated by determining if the net force on each vanishes. If the lithosphere has a Newtonian viscous rheology, the net force on any plate is a strong function of the effective grid spacing used, leading to ambiguities in interpretation. Incorporating a rigid-plastic lithosphere, which fails at a critical yield stress, into the otherwise viscous model removes these ambiguities. The model is extended to the actual three-dimensional (spherical) plate geometry. The observed velocities of rigid-plastic plates are matched to the solution of the viscous Stokes equation at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Body forces from the seismically observed slabs, from the thickening of the lithosphere obtained from the actual lithospheric ages, and from the differences in structure between continents and oceans are included. Interior density contrasts such as those resulting from upwellings from a hot bottom boundary layer are assumed to occur on a scale small compared to plate dimensions and are not included. The driving forces from the density contrasts within the plates are calculated and compared to resisting forces resulting from viscous drag computed from the three-dimensional global return flow and resistance to deformation at converging boundaries; the rms residual torque is {$\sim$}30\% of the driving torque. The density contrasts within the plates themselves can reasonably account for plate motions. Body forces from convection in the interior may provide only a small net force on the plates. At converging boundaries the lithosphere has a yield stress of {$\sim$}100 bars; drag at the base of the plates is {$\sim$}5 bars and resists plate motion. The net driving forces from subducting slabs and collisional resistance are localized and approximately balance. Driving forces from lithospheric thickening are distributed over the areas of the plates, as is viscous drag. The approximate balance of these two forces predicts plate velocities uncorrelated with plate area, as observed. The model represents a specific case of boundary layer convection; the dynamical results are consistent with either upper mantle or mantle-wide convection.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the possibility of using post-glacial rebound observations to place constraints on the anisotropy of upper-mantle viscosity. We extend existing analyses by considering a visco-elastic, spherical, self-gravitating Earth. We show that three independent viscosity parameters are required to describe a Maxwell solid with transversely isotropic viscosity and isotropic elasticity. We develop a theoretical formalism for including the effects of transversely isotropic visco-elasticity in post-glacial rebound models. Using this formalism to describe anisotropy in the upper mantle, we model the free air gravity anomaly, relative sea-level changes, and present-day horizontal motion caused by the rebound, to assess their dependence on the upper-mantle viscosity parameters. We find that as long as those parameters are no larger than the lower-mantle (isotropic) viscosity, the results for the gravity and sea-level changes are notably sensitive to only one of the three viscosity parameters. This suggests, at least for the case where the lower-mantle viscosity is significantly larger than the upper-mantle viscosity, that post-glacial rebound studies of gravity and sea-level will be hard pressed to usefully constrain viscous anisotropy. We do find that the horizontal motion is relatively sensitive to transverse isotropy and so might be used, in principle, to constrain the anisotropy. In practice, though, it is likely that the strong dependence of horizontal motion on details of the ice model, coupled with the uncertainties in existing ice models, would make such attempts impractical. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

To test this resemblance further the ratio of these anomalies, 2, is obtained as a function of wavelength for a variety of simple two-dimensional convective flows. These calculations show that the ratio is insensitive to the Rayleigh number and the degree of internal heating, but is strongly affected by viscosity variations and the depth of the convecting layer. When the viscosity depends on temperature both the surface deformation and the gravity anomaly may be negative over rising regions. Comparison with available observational evidence suggests that variations of viscosity with temperature are dominant only in the vicinity of island arcs.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section In models of crustal deformation at a scale of a few tens of kilometres, it is appropriate to use a Mohr{\textendash}Coulomb yield criterion for lithospheric failure based on the idea that frictional slip occurs on whichever one of many randomly oriented planes happens to be favourably oriented with respect to the stress field. The Drucker{\textendash}Prager yield criterion has very similar characteristics to the Mohr{\textendash}Coulomb criterion but is more straightforward to implement, particularly in the context of large-scale fluid-mechanical deformation of the coupled system of mantle, lithosphere and crust. As such models become more sophisticated it is important to be able to use whichever failure model is appropriate to a given part of the system. We have therefore developed a way to represent Mohr{\textendash}Coulomb failure within the mathematical framework used by mantle-convection fluid dynamics codes. The new formulation is based on the conceptual picture of lithospheric failure incorporated in the Anderson model of fault development and reproduces shear band angles predicted by this model. We use an transversely isotropic viscous rheology (a different viscosity for pure shear to that for simple shear) to define a preferred plane for slip to occur given the local stress field. The simple-shear viscosity and the deformation can then be iterated to ensure that the yield criterion is always satisfied. We assume the Boussinesq approximation can be applied in the model {\textendash} neglecting any effect of dilatancy on the stress field. An additional criterion is required to ensure that deformation occurs along the plane aligned with maximum shear strain rate rather than the perpendicular plane, which is formally equivalent in any symmetric formulation. We compare the behaviour of this formulation to the Drucker{\textendash}Prager failure model for two-dimensional (2D) layered brittle{\textendash}ductile systems. The pattern of shear bands is found to be quite similar from each model, although some differences are seen in the characteristic spacings for `equivalent' values of the material properties. In 3D similar patterns are seen but are modulated by additional 3D structure.},

The fixed Eulerian mesh allows very fast computation, performed in Ellipsis via a multigrid iteration method, while the Lagrangian particle reference frame allows the tracking of material interfaces and history-dependent properties such as strain history for strain-softening materials. The method is exceptionally useful in very large deformation analyses, where purely Lagrangian approaches would be severely hampered by the need for remeshing to minimize element distortion. The Gnu Public Licensed Ellipsis3D code lends itself to combined 2D/3D model prototyping, and has proven to be an excellent geodynamics teaching tool for modelling, covering mantle convection, lithospheric extension and plume{\textendash}lithosphere interaction.},

Whereas exploration for conventional reservoirs has been relatively easy, with expressions of resource found close to or even at the surface, exploration for non-conventional systems relies on temperature inherently increasing with depth and searching for favourable geological environments that maximise this increase. To utilitise the information we do have, we often assimilate available exploration data with models that capture the physics of the dominant underlying processes. Here, we discuss computational modelling approaches to exploration at a regional or crust scale, with application to geothermal reservoirs within basins or systems of basins. Target reservoirs have (at least) appropriate temperature, permeability and are at accessible depths. We discuss the software development approach that leads to effective use of the tool Underworld. We explore its role in the process of modelling, understanding computational error, importing and exporting geological knowledge as applied to the geological system underpinning the Guangdong Province, China.},

  abstract = {In order to obtain a dynamically consistent relationship between the geoid and the earth's response to internal buoyancy forces, we have calculated potential and surface deformation Love numbers for internal loading. These quantities depend on the depth and harmonic degree of loading. They can be integrated as Green functions to obtain the dynamic response due to an arbitrary distribution of internal density contrasts. Spherically symmetric, self-gravitating flow models are constructed for a variety of radial Newtonian viscosity variations and flow configurations including both whole mantle and layered convection. We demonstrate that boundary deformation due to internal loading reaches its equilibrium value on the same time scale as postglacial rebound, much less than the time scale for significant change in the convective flow pattern, by calculating relaxation times for a series of spherically symmetric viscous earth models. For uniform mantle viscosity the geoid signature due to boundary deformations is larger than that due to internal loads, resulting in net negative geoid anomalies for positive density contrasts. Geoid anomalies from intermediate-wavelength density contrasts are amplified by up to an order of magnitude. Geoid anomalies are primarily the result of density contrasts in the interior of convecting layers; density contrasts near layer boundaries are almost completely compensated. Layered mantle convection results in smaller geoid anomalies than mantle-wide flow for a given density contrast. Viscosity stratification leads to more complicated spectral signatures. Because of the sensitivity of the dynamic response functions to model parameters, forward models for the geoid can be used to combine several sources of geophysical data (e.g., subducted slab locations, seismic velocity anomalies, surface topography) to constrain better the structure and viscosity of the mantle.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Numerical subduction models often implement an entrained weak layer (WL) to facilitate decoupling of the slab and upper plate. This approach is attractive in its simplicity, and can provide stable, asymmetric subduction systems that persist for many tens of millions of years. In this study we undertake a methodological analysis of the WL approach, and use these insights to guide improvements to the implementation. The issue that primarily motivates the study is the emergence of significant spatial and temporal thickness variations within the WL. We show that these variations are mainly the response to volumetric flux gradients, caused by the change in boundary conditions as the WL material enters and exits the zone of decoupling. The time taken to reach a quasi-equilibrium thickness profile will depend on the total plate convergence, and is around 7\&thinsp;Myr for the models presented here. During the transient stage, width variations along the WL can exceed 4{\texttimes}, which may impact the effective strength of the interface, through physical effects if the rheology is linear, or simply if the interface becomes inadequately numerically resolved. The transient stage also induces strong sensitivity to model resolution. By prescribing a variable-thickness WL at the outset of the model, and by controlling the limits of the layer thickness during the model evolution, we find improved stability and resolution convergence of the models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Nonetheless, the viability of this mechanism in a three-dimensional stratified lithosphere is controversial. Here we use numerical models to assess how the horizontal stratifica\- tion of the lithosphere affects buckling processes. Our three-dimensional models include a crustal ribbon, rep\- resenting an orogen, embedded in a stratified matrix that consists of an upper mantle layer overlain by a crustal layer. We tested different ribbon geometries (in cross-section) and crustal ribbon viscosities.},

  abstract = {We present a hybrid method for the numerical solution of advection-diffusion problems that combines two standard algorithms: semi-Lagrangian schemes for hyperbolic advection-reaction problems and Crank-Nicolson schemes for purely diffusive problems. We show that the hybrid scheme is identical to the two end-member schemes in the limit of infinite and zero Peclet number and remains accurate over a wide range of Peclet numbers. This scheme does not have a CFL stability criterion allowing the choice of time step to be decoupled from the spatial resolution. We compare numerical results with an analytic solution and test both an operator split version of our method and a combined version that solves advection and diffusion simultaneously. We also compare results of simple explicit and implicit numerical schemes and show that the semi-Lagrangian Crank-Nicolson (SLCN) scheme is both faster and more accurate on the same problem. We then apply the combined SLCN scheme to a more geologically relevant benchmark for calculating the thermal structure of a subduction zone. This problem demonstrates that the SLCN scheme can remain stable and accurate at large Courant numbers even in flows with highly curved streamlines. Finally, we introduce a variable order interpolation scheme for the semi-Lagrangian schemes that reduces interpolation artifacts for sharp fronts without introducing numerical diffusion.},

  abstract = {The particle-in-cell finite element (PIC-FE) method has been widely used in geodynamic numerical modelling due to its efficiency in dealing with large deformations without the requirement of remeshing. However, material deformation within a Eulerian mesh frame will mix particles of contrasting strength properties (e.g., viscosity in Stokes problems) in a single element requiring some form of averaging to project particle properties to inte\- gration points. The numerical solutions are thus dependent on the way how the particle properties are projected to the integration points. An intra-element property discontinuity may introduce severe stress oscillations along the interfaces. In this study, we assess three preprocessing methods to smooth the viscosity contrast within one element. For simplified models with analytical solutions, the accuracy and convergence rate in L2 norm are systematically studied with ensembles. It is found that using higher-order quadrature elements does not improve the convergence rate for either the velocity or stress solution, both close to one. Additionally, the convergence rate of the maximum stress error, which exists adjacent to the mixed-material elements, is much less than one for all cases studied here. Comparing each component of the stress tensor, we find that the stress tensor component with the highest strain rate gradient across the material interface produces the maximum stress error. Such errors can be reduced by averaging the particle properties to the Gaussian quadrature point with an inverse-distanceweighted harmonic mean.},

  abstract = {Concentrated strain within plate margins and a significant toroidal component in global plate motion are among the most fundamental features of plate tectonics. A significant proportion of strain in plate margins is accommodated through motion on major tectonic faults. The decoupling influence of faulted plate margins primarily results from history-dependent lithospheric deformation rather than from instantaneous stress-weakening rheologies. For instantaneous mantle flow models, we argue that faults should be treated as preexisting mechanical structures. With models incorporating preexisting faults, a power law rheology with an exponent of 3, and slab pull and ridge push forces, we demonstrate that nonlinear interaction between weak faults and this power law rheology produces plate-like motion. Our models show that in order to produce plate-like motion, the frictional stress on faults needs to be small and the asthenosphere viscosity should be much weaker than that of lithosphere. While both plateness and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities are reduced with increasing fault coupling, the viscosity contrast between the lithosphere and asthenosphere only influences plateness. This shows that both diagnostics, plateness and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities, are necessary to characterize plate motion. The models demonstrate that weak transform faults can guide plate motion. This guiding property of transform faults and the decoupling of thrust faults result in oblique subduction where the strike of subducted slabs is oblique to transform faults. Subducted slabs beneath a dipping fault produce oceanic trench and fore bulge topography and principal stresses consistent with subduction zone observations.},
